    <p>My name is <strong>Lois</strong> and my pronouns is she/her/hers.</p>
    <p>I'm a ad student and this is my last semaster at CU. I thought being a CTD minor help me in the futrue since I'm interested in going into the creative side of advertising.</p>
    <p>My goal for this course is to learn how to code a website and use it to make my profolio that can show my brand to others, espeically the companies I'm applying to. I also wanted to just learn how to code for fun since I always wanted to have a blog website where I document things that's happening in my life.</p>
